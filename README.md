# SVM VISUALIZER TOOL : A VISUALIZATION TOOL TO HELP STUDENTS UNDERSTAND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES BETTER.
Support Vector Machines is one of the most famous supervised learning algorithms in Data Science.
However, understanding how hyperparameters can affect the performance of this algorithm is quite tricky for a beginner.

When I had started learning SVM, I had found it difficult to imagine or picturize how the decision boundary and threshold lines change when I change the values of the hyperparameters or switch between kernels.

So, I decided to make a simple web app that helped students visualize the SVM algorithm according to their choice of hyperparameter setting.

### About the web app :
The web app consists of two pages :

1. The HOME page : The home page is basically the gateway to the visual tool. It also consists a link that redirects the user to blogs on SVM, in case the user wants to have a short read.

2. The main page : The SVM VISUAL TOOL

This page contains the main plot that is generated upon changing the settings below the plot on the left hand side.

Tech stack :
Frontend : HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Flask.

Backend : Dash, Python.
